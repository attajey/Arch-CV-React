            This research was focused on studying different rural houses of
            distinct climates in Iran, in order to achieve unique patterns for
            building sustainable rural houses, by using local materials and
            resources and minimizing the energy consumption in different
            climates.  Many books and researches were studied and summarized.
            Unfortunately, the program was delayed due to my research
            supervisor’s busy schedule.
