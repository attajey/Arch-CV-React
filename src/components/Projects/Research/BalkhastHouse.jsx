            In this research, we first chose an antique, non restored house,
            then we analyzed the history, plans, elevations, sections, social
            and cultural studies, parts in need of renovation, found innovative
            techniques that would not harm the building. Finally designed an
            adjunct space and changed its functionality in order to achieve
            prosperity and reviviscent.Â
